🍿 Netflix Clone
Welcome to TotallyNotNetflix™ – because why pay for streaming when you can build your own and still not watch anything?

This is a clone of Netflix that won't get you sued (hopefully). It looks like Netflix, feels like Netflix, but streams zero movies because... copyright. 🙃

🚀 Features
🔥 Homepage hotter than your CPU fan at 3AM

🍔 Responsive like your crush's "seen" on Messenger

🎬 Movie thumbnails that don’t play anything (but look super clickable)

👀 Hover effects that say "I'm trying my best"

💡 Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (aka the holy trinity of "I Googled it")

📺 Firebase-auth that lets you log in... and that's about it.

🧠 Tech Stack
Tech	Why?
React	Because everyone else is using it
Firebase	Free backend until you hit the limit
TMDB API	So we look legit with movie posters
CSS	Styled like your favorite 2008 blog
Vite	Because create-react-app is so 2022

🤓 How to Run Locally
Clone this bad boy:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-clone.git
Navigate into the chaos:

cd netflix-clone
Install the drama:

npm install
Start the show:


npm run dev
🎉 Boom. Fake Netflix on your browser.

😬 Known Bugs
No actual movies

Login works... until it doesn’t

UI so sleek it might cut your eyes

You might get addicted to just scrolling

🏆 Credits
Built by [Shafin Uddin] while pretending to be productive.
Design inspired by Netflix, but the code is all "Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and vibes".

⚠️ Disclaimer
This is for educational purposes only.
Do not use it to build the next "Netflox" or "Moviez4U" – FBI is watching. 👀

📬 Feedback?
Open an issue or just shout into the void – I probably won’t hear it, but it’s cathartic.

Now go binge something real. You've earned it. 🍕📺
